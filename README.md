# Documentation

This is the documentation **source** for this repository.

The **deployed** version of the documentation for this repository is available at:

- https://docs.hummingbot.io/

## Documentation for the documentation

This `README.md` is intentionally short since the [documentation for the documentation](https://github.com/apollographql/gatsby-theme-apollo/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-apollo-docs#gatsby-theme-apollo-docs) provides details for the documentation framework _itself_.

## Running locally

For more information, consult the documentation for the documentation, referenced above.

In general though:

- `npm install` in this directory
- `npm start` in this directory
- Open a browser to the link provided in the console.

## Deploy previews

Documentation repositories should be setup with a "deploy preview" feature which automatically provides "preview" links in the _status checks_ section of pull-requests.

In the event that it's not possible to run the documentation locally, pushing changes to the branch for a pull-request can be a suitable alternative that ensures changes to the documentation are properly rendered.
