## How is performance calculated?

**Trading P&L** =
`base_asset_trade_delta` \* `base_asset_usd_exchange_rate` (at the end of query period) + `quote_asset_trade_delta` \*`quote_asset_usd_exchange_rate` (at the end of query period) - sum (`fee_amount` \* `fee_asset_usd_exchange_rate` (at time of transaction)) for each trade.

**Total P&L** =
`trading_p&l` + sum(`liquidity_mining_rewards` \* (at the end of query period))
