- **TOTAL ACTIVE BOTS** is the total number of market making bots currently running/
- **LIQUIDITY** is the total eligible open order volume across all Active Bots currently.
- **YIELD/DAY** shows you how much you can earn per day currently. To calculate Yield/Day, divide the daily reward (**Reward/Day**) by Liquidity.

> **Note:** The Yield/Day is solely based on liquidity rewards and does not take into account trades executed.

> **Important:** The published Yield/Day metrics only include reward payments versus order volumes. They _do not_ capture the individual miner's profit or loss on the underlying strategy or any transaction fees (if any) that generated the orders created. As a result, _liquidity mining yields are not an indication of a miner's overall portfolio return_; miners should take into consideration overall economics, and not just mining return, when deciding on participating in liquidity mining campaigns.

The snapshot section is divided into three areas:

- Liquidity — displays the total/ask/bid volume for all miners and your miner
- Spread — displayes the mid/ask/bid price for all miners and your miner
- Rewards earned — displays the rewards earn by all miners and your miner

> **Note:** The column "JUST ME" displays the statistics only when your miner is running and statisfy the campaign requirements.
