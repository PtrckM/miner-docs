title: Payouts
---

Each weekly epoch runs begins and ends at Tuesday 12am UTC. Rewards are distributed to each participant's registered Ethereum address 3 calendar days after the end of each epoch.

Payouts provides a summary of all the payments including the breakdown of each liquidity rewards, and allows user to check the etherscan transcation.

**Minimum reward payout amount**

Due to the surge in Ethereum gas price, Hummingbot will impose a **\$50.00** minimum on the weekly payout **for payments on the Ethereum blockchain (currently USDT and RLC)**, starting with the next scheduled payout on September 18th (UTC).

For miners who earn less than **\$50** within one week, their rewards will be accrued and rolled over to the next period and displayed under **Accrued Balance** table.

The following screenshot displays the payouts summary.
