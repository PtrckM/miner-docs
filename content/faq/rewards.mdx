## About Liquidity mining rewards calculation

In order to make economic sense for a market maker, the market maker’s compensation must correlate with increased levels of risk. There are three main parameters that we use in liquidity mining to determine market maker compensation: (1) **time**: placing orders in the order book consistently over time, (2) **spreads**, and (3) **order sizes**.

In liquidity mining, market makers accumulate more rewards by consistently placing orders over time and earn higher rewards by placing orders with tighter spreads and with larger sizes. The real-time reward information will be displayed in the real-time Hummingbot Miner dashboard.

## How is performance calculated?

Trading P&L =

`base_asset_trade_delta` \* `base_asset_usd_exchange_rate` (at the end of query period) +

`quote_asset_trade_delta` \*`quote_asset_usd_exchange_rate` (at the end of query period) -

sum (`fee_amount` \* `fee_asset_usd_exchange_rate` (at time of transaction)) for each trade.

Total P&L =

`trading_p&l` + sum(`liquidity_mining_rewards` \* (at the end of query period))

## Why is there no rewards after registration?

Note that it may takes up to 1 hour for our system to start tracking newly created bots and crediting them with rewards.

Also, please check that:

- You are not running Hummingbot in paper trading mode, which doesn't place real orders
- Your bot is actually placing orders on the exchange. You should be able to see them in the exchange website.
- If you are running Hummingbot in a Mac or Windows computer, your machine didn't go to sleep which prevents Hummingbot from maintaining orders.

If these 3 reasons are not the cause, you can email a CSV export of your Binance order history for a particular market to [accounts@hummingbot.io](mailto:accounts@hummingbot.io). Note that we can only provide you with our system's data and cannot credit users for past rewards.
