Liquidity mining is a community-based, data-driven approach to market making, in which a token issuer or exchange can reward a pool of miners to provide liquidity for a specified token.

- **Open - Anyone can participate\***
- **Real time - Track your earnings every minute**
- **Non-custodial - We can't access your tokens**

You earn rewards by running a market making bot that maintains orders on exchange order books. How much reward you earn depends on:

- The amount of your orders
- The spread (distance to the mid price) of your orders
- How long you maintain your orders on the order book
- The amount of your orders
- The spread (distance to the mid price) of your orders
- How long you maintain your orders on the order book

For more information, please read [the whitepaper](https://hummingbot.io/liquidity-mining.pdf).

## Current Campaign Terms

> **Terms are subjected to change:** We will notify participants of changes, if any, on our [Discord](https://discord.hummingbot.io) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hummingbot/). Participants can also check the latest news in the [Hummingbot Miner](https://miners.hummingbot.io/) app.

**Updated liquidity mining policy on payments**

Qualified participants will be eligible to receive compensation in accordance with each liquidity mining campaign’s schedule of Liquidity Mining Payments, which will be based on each participant’s trading activity (in particular, orders placed and their sizes and spreads) in the tokens subject to the liquidity mining campaign.

**Wallet address**  
Participants must enter a valid wallet address applicable for the campaign that they are participating in. Wallet address are use for receiving payouts only, you do not need deposit assets into or trade using this wallet.  
For more details on how to obtain wallet address and its requiremets, please refer to our docs on [Liquidity Mining FAQs](http://localhost:8000/resources/liquidity-mining/)

> **Warning:** CoinAlpha does not take any responsibility and will not reimburse for any loss of funds due to a participant submitting an incorrect or invalid wallet address.

> **Important:** Orders outstanding for more than 30 minutes not counted for rewards

Work on removing this limit is in progress, you can read more about it in our [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hummingbot/comments/hz5xv3/tracking_rewards_for_orders_longer_than_30m/).

> **Tip:** To ensure that orders do not stay outstanding for longer than 30 minutes, Hummingbot users should disable [order refresh tolerance](strategies/order-refresh-tolerance/).

**Minimum reward payout amount**

Due to the recent surge in Ethereum gas price, Hummingbot will impose a **\$50.00** minimum on the weekly payout **for payments on the Ethereum blockchain (currently USDT and RLC)**, starting with the next scheduled payout on September 18th (UTC).

For miners who earn less than **\$50** within one week, their rewards will be accrued and rolled over to the next period, read more in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hummingbot/comments/ip4mc3/announcement_raising_minimum_payment_to_50/).

> **Note:** XZC payments are not subject to a minimum payout reward; all payouts will be made for each period.

**Enabling USDT for USD-based payments**

Starting from the rewards period beginning on October 6, 2020 12.00am UTC, all USD-based rewards will be accrued in USDT.

**ZCoin campaign paused**

ZCoin is putting its campaign on pause and will continue to monitor and re-evaluate the liquidity for its token. They are one of our original launch partners and we appreciate their support of our platform so far!

\* Spread density function constant is one of the factors that determines the relative weighting of orders by spread, i.e., the amount of additional rewards for orders with tighter spreads vs those with wider spreads. Refer to this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mUZsQoiqlMs5HjcL6AXSKIx1oaULsmuQStJaCc2wggQ/edit?ts=5f1e89bd#gid=18167917) for the spread weights and for a visual of the graph that shows the curve.

> **Note:** You can use your own trading bots and strategies to participate in liquidity mining. For the general pool of users who don't have their own trading bots, Hummingbot was created to provide them access to quant/algo strategies and the ability to market make.

With Zcoin’s Sigma feature, only the sender and receiver would be able to ascertain the exchange of funds in a given transaction, as no transaction histories are linked to the actual coins. Zcoin is also the creator of the Lelantus privacy protocol which improves Sigma's privacy and functionality. Its ZC token has been listed on Binance, Huobi Global, Bittrex, etc.
